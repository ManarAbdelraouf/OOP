# OOP
Design a simple logic simulator that provides a mechanism to run and simulate logic circuits then find the desired outputs for different designs.



Create a class called "Node" that has name and value data members to represent each node in the circuit such as node A, B in the above circuit.

Class "Node" should have the following Specifications:

Default and non-default Constructor.

Provide setters and getters.

Overload the operator ostream << to print the node information.

Create methods called AND() / OR() / XOR() to perform the logical operation between two nodes objects.

Add any needed functions according to your design.

Create a class Called "Gate" which has two input nodes and one output node data members.

Class Gate should support the following methods:

Default and non-default Constructors.

Provide getters and setters for its nodes.

Implement the gate types AND / OR / NAND / NOR / XOR / XNOR / NOT.

function simulateGate() returns the logic value of the gate according to its type.

Create a class called "Simulator" which accpets all types of gates then calculate circuitsâ€™ outputs, It has the following specifications:

array of pointers to Gate and array of pointers to Node.

Method postGate() accepts a pointer to a created gate to insert it into the array.

Method postNode() accepts a pointer to a created node to insert it into the array.

Method FindNode() accepts a string node's name to find it in the container and return its address.

Method startSimulate() start the simulation for each gate by looping over the gates container

Note: Only one object can be created from the Simualtor class.

Recommended: Make the gates container and nodes container as a vector to be easliy dynamic allocated during the simulation.

Create a class called "GateGenerator" that generates the nodes and all sepcified gates from the input then post them to the simulator.

"GateGenerator" class should have the following specifications:

Function parseInput() reads the inputs and parses each keyword ("SIM"/"OUT",..) to the appropriate logic.

Function createNode() creates a node and return its address.

Function createGate() creates a (AND,OR,...) gates according to the input and return its address, it is advisable to use a factory function to have better practice on polymorphic objects.

Add any needed functions as your design says so!.


Input Format

The input follows these formats:


gate type (such as AND/OR gate)

The inputs and output symbols

Write "SET" values to the inputs (either 0 or 1)

Write "SIM" to start simulation

Write "OUT" to view the output of a specific node or "OUT ALL" to view all nodes' values

Constraints

Do not use C type casting.

Do not use void pointers.

Do not use friend functions or friend classes except (ostream overloading function).

Do not declare any variable public.

Do not declare all your functions public. Make decisions for which ones will be public, private or protected.

The code should have 0 warning.


Output Format

Output format should be the node symbol: node Value.
